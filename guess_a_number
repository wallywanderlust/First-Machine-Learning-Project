# This game is called Guess a Number. The goal of this project was to write code that would allow a user to guess a random number. 



import random 

rn = random.randint(0,100)
win = False
while win == False:    
    guess = input("Enter Your Guess: ")        
    if rn == int(guess):
        print("You guessed the number! Would you like to play again?")
        win == True
        break
                
    elif int(guess) < rn:
        print("Your guess is too low")
              
    elif int(guess) > rn:
        print("Your guess is too high")
        
Enter Your Guess: 45
Your guess is too low
Enter Your Guess: 89
Your guess is too high
Enter Your Guess: 67
Your guess is too high
Enter Your Guess: 55
