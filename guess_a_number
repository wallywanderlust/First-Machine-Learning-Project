# This game is called Guess a Number. The goal of this project was to write code that would allow a user to guess a random number. If you want to know more about this project
# and the thought process that went into it, you can visit my blog at https://walterlearnspython.wordpress.com/2021/03/05/week-2-of-my-data-analysis-coding-learning-journey/
