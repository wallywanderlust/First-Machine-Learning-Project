# First Machine Learning Project Titanic Data

The famous Titanic project! Here is my version of the machine learning Titanic project. The goal of this project is to construct a predictive model that can predict survivors
on the Titanic. I used several different predictive models with varying levels of accuracy. Blog Post Titanic was the first draft. Titanic revised is the final draft. Enjoy and thanks for reading! -Walter
